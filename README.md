# Tesseract Trac-IK plugin

This is a [Trac-IK](https://traclabs.com/projects/trac-ik/) plugin for `tesseract_kinematics`. It is not included in the main tesseract repository, as it depends on a [ROS 2 fork of trac_ik_lib](https://github.com/aprotyas/trac_ik), which is ROS-dependent.

## Future work

The `trac_ik_lib` dependency should be made ROS-agnostic before this plugin can be included in the `tesseract` repo.
